=============

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment,
management and scaling of containerized applications
across a cluster [6]. The more granular an application is, the
more components it consists of and thus requires management
of these components. Kubernetes helps in faster deployment
of applications and scaling them on the fly. Moreover it optimizes
the use of hardware by using the resources which are
needed. Kubernetes provides container management features
like component replication, load-balancing, service-discovery
and logging across components [7]. A Kubernetes cluster can
be deployed on either physical or virtual machines. We shall
be deploying a kubernetes cluster using kubeadm - the kubernetes
command line tool and Minikube which is a lightweight
Kubernetes implementation which creates a VM on the local
machine and deploys a simple cluster containing only one node.
The Minikube CLI provides basic bootstrapping operations for
working with the cluster, including start, stop, status, and delete
commands.
